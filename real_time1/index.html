        <h2>Sass For Web Designers</h2>
        <p>
          I’m dusting off this ol’ website to announce that, today, my fifth
          book has been published. It’s called
          <a href="#">Sass For Web Designers</a> and has a familiar pink cover.
          The book is the 10th release from the wonderful folks at
          <a href="#">A Book Apart</a>. They are the best team an author could
          hope to work with, and I was honored to follow up
          <a href="#">CSS3 For Web Designers</a> with a book about
          <a href="#">Sass</a>
          (something I was reluctant to embrace for years). And that’s why I
          wanted to write this book: To convince other folks like me out there
          that Sass can make their lives easier and more efficient when it comes
          to creating websites. book I thank
          <a href="#">Dribbble</a> Co-Founder, <a href="#">Rich Thornett</a>,
          for being relentless in advocating Sass’ benefits while I resisted for
          probably about a year. Once I discovered that I didn’t need to learn
          complex programming or command line shenanigans, and that it didn’t
          need to immediately change my workflow or interrupt the way I’ve been
          writing CSS for a decade, well then I was hooked. Using Sass doesn’t
          mean having to learn Sass in its entirety. You can start small, and
          slowly add more of Sass’ capabilities over time—even on large,
          complex, legacy stylesheets. It’s what I’ve been doing with Dribbble’s
          CSS for a long time now. Converting more and more of the stylesheet to
          Sass as needed, or as I have time to refactor things and/or learn more
          about what Sass can help with. You can start quickly and easily, then
          incrementally add more Sass power as you become more comfortable with
          it. Again, my primary goal for this little pink book is to simply get
          more people interested in using Sass to make their lives easier. Sass
          is a wonderfully helpful tool with a great community behind it, in a
          discipline that can be complicated and frustrating. I’m hoping you
          give Sass, and the book, a try! And now for a heaping pile of thank
          yous. To Jeffrey Zeldman, Jason Santa Maria, and Mandy Brown for
          creating a place that I genuinely want to write for. To Katel LeDu for
          being a fantastic project manager and steering things the entire way.
          This year has been particular rough for me personally, so it’s
          especially satisfying to see this thing actually released. To Erin
          Kissane for making me sound far better than I actually am. Thanks also
          to Jina Bolton for tech editing the book, as well as her work for the
          Sass community in general. To Chris Coyier for being smarter than all
          of us and agreeing to write a foreword. Also to Hampton Caitlin, Jenn
          Lukas, and Chris Eppstein for saying nice things about the book and
          letting us print those nice things on the inside cover (which Jason
          brilliantly selected to be Dribbble pink, naturally) among the other
          awesome things they do for the web. Like, I don’t know, creating Sass,
          building Sass, and generally being rad. Here’s some things you could
          do now that you’ve reached the end of this fascinating post:
